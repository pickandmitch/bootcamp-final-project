*What the project does*

This project was designed to explore whether addtional exploratory data visualization of the data generated by a network penetration service could provide added-value insights as well as means of identifying how to calculate a quality metric for SMS routes. 


*Why the project is useful*

This is useful because real customers of the service today receive an excel file with several columns of data. For many customers familiar with the service, they will have enough knowledge to scan and interpret the data themselves to some extent. However for other audiences within customer organizations, they are unlikely to engage with the excel file and thus the service's potential remains limited. If the data is presented visually through an explanatory dataviz layer however, this could facilitate more constructive, cross-functional conversations that lead to actions being taken and value being added.
